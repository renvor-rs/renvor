# Waiver Ledger

**Status**: **3 active waivers** — W-001 (approval gap, seeded at T015), W-002 (ADR review gap), and **W-003 (Phase 001 independent-review gap, granted 2026-08-15 at T088)**.
**Satisfies**: spec FR-015, FR-051; constitution §Governance
**Schema**: `specs/001-governance-foundation/data-model.md` §Waiver Record

> **All seven fields are mandatory.** The constitution permits exceptions only through a
> time-bounded written waiver naming the violated rule, reason, compensating controls,
> owner, expiry, and removal plan.

> **`expiry` must include an absolute date.** A release condition may accompany it, and
> the waiver ends at whichever arrives first. A condition alone is not permitted — a
> condition that never occurs would never expire, which is not time-bounded.

> **Compensating controls must be specific to the gap.** A control that another
> requirement already mandates unconditionally compensates for nothing and may not be
> cited.

> **Security release blockers cannot be waived** for a public release.

## Active waivers

| ID | Violated rule | Reason | Compensating controls | Owner | Expiry (date / condition) | Removal plan | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **W-001** | spec FR-027 and constitution §Development and Phase Workflow — a pull request MUST carry an approving review from someone other than its author | The project has a single maintainer. No second person can approve, so the required-reviewer rule cannot be satisfied without blocking all work | (1) The **complete verification sequence** of `specs/001-governance-foundation/contracts/verification-sequence.md` — all 10 steps — passes on **every** pull request, with `verify (1.94.0)`, `verify (stable)`, `security`, and `docs` all required to succeed before merge; (2) the **scanning gates** all report clean on every pull request: secret scanning with push protection, CodeQL, dependency review, `cargo-deny` (licences, advisories, bans, sources), and `gitleaks` over history and tree | Ahmed Anbar | **2027-02-11**, or immediately when a second maintainer with merge rights joins the project — whichever comes first | Add the second maintainer to the repository, enable the required-approving-review setting, re-review any change merged under this waiver, and close the waiver | `active` |
| **W-002** | spec FR-013 and constitution §Development and Phase Workflow #4 — a decision record MUST NOT be accepted without a recorded **independent** review | The project has a single maintainer. No second person qualifies as independent, so no genuinely independent review of a Phase 001 decision record is available | (1) Written alternatives-and-consequences review completed against the ADR template before acceptance; (2) verification against `specs/001-governance-foundation/checklists/governance.md`; (3) all required CI and security checks passing; (4) a dated review record stored with the ADR | Ahmed Anbar | **2027-02-11**, or immediately when a qualified independent reviewer becomes available — whichever comes first | Raise the review requirement to a genuinely independent reviewer as soon as one is available, re-review every ADR accepted under this waiver, and close the waiver | `active` |
| **W-003** | `PLAN.md` §6.1 step 10 and constitution §Development and Phase Workflow #7 — a phase MUST obtain an **independent requirements and security review** before it closes, comparing implementation evidence against the specification, constitution, compatibility matrix, and security checklist. Tracked as **T088** | The project has a single maintainer. No second person qualifies as independent under the `GOVERNANCE.md` definition, so no genuinely independent human review of Phase 001 is available. **W-002 covers decision-record review only (FR-013) and does not reach this phase-level gate** | (1) **Two clean-context advisory reviews per pull request closing Phase 001** — one requirements, one security — each run against an explicit written requirement list, each producing findings that are recorded and **individually dispositioned** (fixed, or refused with a stated reason) in `governance/phase-001-evidence.md`, and each labelled **NON-INDEPENDENT and ADVISORY**; (2) **every claim of current external state verified read-only against the system that owns it**, with the verification method **and its limits** recorded — including claims that could not be verified and why; (3) **a written adversarial pass whose sole objective is to falsify the phase's own claims**, recorded with what it found; (4) **Phase 001 closes with its open gaps transferred and visible rather than closed** — the four deployment gates stay non-completed and enumerated. *(CI, gitleaks, CodeQL, `cargo-deny`, dependency review, and secret scanning are **already mandated unconditionally** and are therefore **not** cited here — a control another rule already requires compensates for nothing.)* | Ahmed Anbar | **2027-02-11**, or **immediately** when a qualified independent human reviewer becomes available — **whichever occurs first** | The first qualified independent reviewer re-reviews Phase 001 **in full** against the specification, constitution, compatibility matrix, and security checklist; T088 is then satisfied properly rather than waived; the phase record is updated with the outcome; W-003 closes | `active` |

### W-003 — scope, stated as narrowly as it was granted

**Approved by Ahmed Anbar on 2026-08-15.** The following limits are part of the grant, not
commentary on it:

- **W-003 waives only the independent-human-review requirement for Phase 001.**
- **It does not waive any finding, failed check, missing evidence, acceptance criterion, or
  security blocker.** Anything that fails remains failed; anything unevidenced remains
  unevidenced. A waiver of *who reviews* is not a waiver of *what must be true*.
- **No independent human review of Phase 001 has occurred.**
- **Agent and self-review are advisory and explicitly non-independent**, and must never be
  described as independent — in this record, in the evidence pack, in `GOVERNANCE.md`, or in
  any public document. The advisory reviews performed were genuinely useful and found real
  defects; that does not make them independent.
- **Security release blockers are never waived.** The constitution's prohibition is unchanged
  and W-003 does not touch it.
- **Phase 001 must receive genuine independent re-review before any public release.**
- It expires on **2027-02-11** or when a qualified reviewer becomes available, **whichever
  occurs first**.

**T088 is recorded as `WAIVED / NOT MET`, never as completed.** It is not a completed task and
must not be counted as one.

## Waiver categories and expected counts

Three categories are tracked separately. They are **not** interchangeable, and a waiver in
one category does not consume the allowance of another.

| Category | Expected count | Waivers |
|---|---|---|
| Repository **approval** waivers | exactly **1** | **W-001** — single-maintainer approval gap *(seeded 2026-08-11 at T015)*. **Unchanged by W-003** |
| **Control-unavailability** waivers | **0** | none expected — research Finding 3 confirmed every required repository control is free on the public tier, so cost or plan tier is never an accepted reason |
| **Explicit reviewed exceptions** | outside the counts above | **W-002** — ADR independent-review gap; **W-003** — Phase 001 independent requirements-and-security-review gap *(granted 2026-08-15)* |

**W-002 and W-003 are explicit reviewed exceptions, not part of the normal expected waiver
count.** Each was granted by a recorded maintainer decision — W-002 on 2026-08-11, W-003 on
2026-08-15 — rather than arising from a design shortfall, and neither indicates that anything
in the design failed to work. **Both exist for the same underlying reason: the project has one
person.** They are separate waivers because they cover different rules at different levels —
W-002 covers decision-record review (FR-013), W-003 covers phase-level requirements and
security review (`PLAN.md` §6.1 step 10). **Neither consumes the other's allowance, and
neither raises the approval-waiver count, which stays exactly 1 (W-001), or the
control-unavailability count, which stays 0.**

## Decision-record review under W-002 (ruling of 2026-08-11, T006)

While W-002 is active:

- The reviewer field of every Phase 001 decision record reads exactly
  **`Ahmed Anbar — self-review under W-002`**.
- This review **MUST NOT** be described as independent, in the record, in the evidence
  pack, in `GOVERNANCE.md`, or in any public document. It is a structured self-review
  operating under a recorded exception.
- No decision record may reach `accepted` until all four compensating controls listed for
  W-002 have been completed and the review record is dated.
- `GOVERNANCE.md` (written at **T048**) MUST transcribe this reviewer-qualification ruling
  verbatim, including the prohibition on calling the review independent.

## Closed and expired waivers

| ID | Closed on | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| *(none)* | | |

A waiver reaching its date without its condition being met is **not** automatically
renewed. It must be re-justified and re-dated, or the underlying rule complied with. An
expired-but-open waiver is a release blocker.
